Avada Quizevra is the ultimate fun quiz that has been specifically designed for the ultimate Harry Potter fan also known as "Potterheads".

My approach for designing this Quiz game application was to create it so that it is not only accessible to view on desktop but it is also mobile responsive. The application is also accessible through a range of different devices.

You will get directed to the Netlify app to create a new site. You should find the following page, asking you to connect to GitHub.

2.Select Connect to GitHub to authenticate. If you don’t already have a Netlify user account, you will get one as part of this process.

3.Select Save & Deploy. As well as creating a new site on Netlify, this process clones the demo project repository to your GitHub account so you can make your own changes later on.

You will be redirected to the Site overview page where you can check for the deploy in the Production deploys list.
