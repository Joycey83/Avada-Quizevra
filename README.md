# Avada Quizevra : Quiz Game Application

# Introduction

Avada Quizevra is a web based application designed using HTML5, CSS and Java Script. Avada Quizevra is the ultimate fun quiz that has been specifically designed for the ultimate Harry Potter fan also known as "Potterheads". The quiz consists of 30 hard questions that are based from the books and films. This quiz will test their knowledge and push their limits on how much that they really know about Harry Potter.

My approach for designing this Quiz game application was to create it so that it is not only accessible to view on desktop but it is also mobile responsive. The application is also accessible through a range of different devices.
