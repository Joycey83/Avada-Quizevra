Avada Quizevra is the ultimate fun quiz that has been specifically designed for the ultimate Harry Potter fan also known as "Potterheads".

My approach for designing this Quiz game application was to create it so that it is not only accessible to view on desktop but it is also mobile responsive. The application is also accessible through a range of different devices.
